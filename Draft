Some ideas for what we are doing:

Research question(s):

Are two step of care verticaly linked ?  (e.g part of a recuring care pathway)

  How can we define a care pathway ? 

Are transfers vertical or horizontal ?

Are exaugenous chocs detectable using probabilities of transfer ? 

Our cuurent dataset at the hospital level are limited for this application as it does not capture the different axis of 

A) Litterature

H. de Oliviera 2020

B) Matrix transformations

C) Simulations

  i) The problem of general equilibrium with a large number of matrices
  ii) Probabilities of transfers for HA/HB & E/S
  iii) Verticality of transfers, a classifier approach 
  iv) Change in the probability of probabilities following an exogenous choc
  v) Evaluation of the magnitude of the effect


D) Model setup on limited data

  Use of the simulation for application on a limited dataset and an exogenous choc.
